# recursive-motion
Replacing Cartesian-based motion with a recursive model that respects Radiation Coordinate Systems as defined by The Unified Theory of Energy:

"Theorem 4   Each Radiation Source will have its own Coordinate System dictated by the total number, and therefore the total possible motion, of Particles within that Radiation Source.
The number of Particles dictates how far Radiation can extend within the Radiation Coordinate System.

Every Radiation Coordinate System will be completely contained within a larger Radiation Coordinate System. An Electron will be contained within the reach of its Nucleus. An Atom will be contained within a Molecule. A Planet will be contained within a Solar System. A Star will be contained within a Galaxy. A Galaxy will be contained within a Universe. A Universe will be contained within an Electron.

From this we can be sure a cloud of Particles orbits an Electron, which is also a Solar System on some Scale.

Definition 6   Scale refers to the relative size of any Radiation Source.
Every Radiation Source will have an "Electron" within its Scale at the appropriate level. The Electron itself can be a Radiation Source being orbited by smaller Particles like "planets" and those again being orbited by smaller Particles like "moons" until the smallest functional Particle below that specific Radiation Source is found, which would then also be called an Electron.

We can, thus, use Scale to consider the Sun as a Radiation Source being orbited by eight Particles and realize our Solar System is an Oxygen Molecule on a different Scale. This would also prove our Galaxy to be an Aether with respect to Scale. This further proves that, on some specific Scale, our own atmosphere's breathable air is also vacuous."
